# Surf Forecast Data Source

## Current Implementation

The app currently uses **mock surf forecast data** generated by the `SurfForecastService` (`src/services/surfForecastService.ts`). This service simulates real-time surf conditions for demonstration purposes.

## Mock Data Generation

The mock service generates realistic surf forecasts based on:

- **Location characteristics**: Each surf destination has predefined wave patterns and seasonal variations
- **Seasonal factors**: Wave heights and conditions vary by month based on real-world surf patterns
- **Realistic ranges**: Wave heights (0.5-12ft), wind speeds (5-25 knots), water temperatures (12-28Â°C)
- **Time-based updates**: Forecasts refresh every 15 minutes with slight variations to simulate real conditions

## For Production Use

To integrate real surf forecast data, replace the mock service with one of these APIs:

### Recommended Surf Forecast APIs

1. **Surfline API** (Premium)
   - Most comprehensive surf data
   - Global coverage with local surf spots
   - Real-time and 7-day forecasts
   - Wave height, period, direction, wind, tides
   - Cost: ~$50-200/month depending on usage

2. **Stormglass Marine Weather API**
   - Weather and ocean data including wave forecasts
   - Global coverage
   - Multiple data sources combined
   - Cost: Freemium model, paid tiers from $50/month

3. **World Weather Online Marine API**
   - Basic surf and marine weather data
   - Global coverage
   - Cost: From $15/month

4. **NOAA/NDBC (Free - US only)**
   - National Data Buoy Center
   - Real buoy data for US coastlines
   - Free but limited to US waters

### Implementation Notes

When integrating a real API:

1. Update the `SurfForecastService.getForecast()` method to make HTTP requests to your chosen API
2. Add API key configuration to environment variables
3. Update the `SurfForecast` interface if needed to match API response structure
4. Implement proper error handling for API failures
5. Consider rate limiting and caching strategies
6. Add fallback to mock data when API is unavailable

### Current Mock Forecast Features

- Wave height (0.5-12ft range)
- Wind speed and direction
- Water temperature
- Surf quality rating (1-10)
- Crowd level estimation
- 15-minute cache duration
- Destination-specific patterns (e.g., Hawaii gets bigger waves, UK gets colder water)

The mock service is designed to be easily replaceable with a real API while maintaining the same interface for the UI components.
